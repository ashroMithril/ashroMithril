I wish to grow like a tree, <br>
With curves of it's own, <br>
not all of them very perfect, <br>
but a beauty that no one can frown, <br>
with leaves and sometimes without, <br>
it makes me wonder how it changes in a bout, <br>
It takes time to settle in the roots, <br>
in that period it dies just as many times as it shoots, <br>
but once a stump is out, <br>
then oh dear there is no doubt, <br>
it grows higher and higher, <br>
and becomes a life of itself. <br>
Providing shade and shelter for free, <br>
Giving humans and animals a pree, <br>
By it’s own strength under the light of the sun, <br>
Waving it’s pretty strands, <br>
Along with all it’s friends, <br>
