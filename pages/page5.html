I wish to grow like a tree, <br>
With curves of it's own, <br>
not all of them very perfect, <br>
but a beauty that no one can frown, <br>
with leaves and sometimes without, <br>
it makes me wonder how it changes in a bout, <br>
It takes time to settle in the roots, <br>
in that period it dies just as many times as it shoots, <br>
but once a stump is out, <br>
then oh dear there is no doubt, <br>
it grows higher and higher, <br>
and becomes a life of itself. <br>
Providing shade and shelter for free, <br>
Giving humans and animals a pree, <br>
By it’s own strength under the light of the sun, <br>
Waving it’s pretty strands, <br>
Along with all it’s friends, <br>

<br> Sometimes liqguistics play an annoying role, What I really wanted to say was in hindi is mentioned below.
<br> <br>
Aaj ek zikra hai zikra yaad aaya,
<br>ki kaise inn minaro ne insan ko alag kr diya, pr ye ped toh ab bhi bina kisi rok k har taraf har minar k neeche ek ban kr khade hai, na waqt ki seema hai aur lafzo ka bandhan, hawa chali toh yuhi jhoom liye, fiza bahi toh chahchaha liye, jo cheez sabko bejaan lagti hai, ussi ki wajah se hum sab me jaan hai,
agar mein bhi kuch zikra kru toh hum bhi ek podha hi toh hai, jo ek mitti se dusri mein me aaye hai, 
pta hai jab ek ped ek mitti se dusri mitti mein aata hai toh woh pehle marta hai aur phir saans lena seekhta hai aur phir na jaane kitne patthar khakar, kitni baarishon mein tanha rhkar, vasant aate hi phull dene lagta hai, ur aakhirkar jeena seekh jate hai...
