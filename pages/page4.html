Yeah right!
Call it helplessness or just the way life is, everyone is supposed to leave one day. 
We cross each others path sharing love, memories, secrets, weirdness, food and sometimes science too but at the end it comes with an expiry date where best friends becomes acquaintances out of which very few survive and rest the ones we often used to see, becomes invisible without a goodbye. 
May be a goodbye can never be enough, After all its hard to believe that the people you have cherished spending time with, will be hard to see without a plan and soon the frequency of texts and calls will fade and new friends will take more space.
(The ones who still have their childhood bestie as a bestie, I salute you â™¥ and is jealous too because I see mine once a year.
And the ones who think they have left something behind without a good bye, go find them and let them know how important they were and will be!)
Fortunately, all goodbyes are good and we are strong human beings who learn to live with changes, for a better world with less pain that we all want to be a part of is okay with us keep moving, keeping with us the colorful shadows of sweet and sour that motivates us. corrects us and pushes us to be a better person.


Another one with the same feel - 
<b style="font-size: 29px">When impermanence strikes you.</b> <br>

And I will have to leave this place after a few months from now.I know I am not the same person as I came in, that girl was free, ambitious and hated boys. I am something else and now I am smiling at that fact that I agree to this that I have really changed.I have made many relationships, good ones that I'd keep for the rest of my life and the ones that got broken, some unfortunate experiences whose shadow will stay with me forever. 
It seems like I am at the verge of this stage of life. Where I transformed from a girl to a lady, from a teen to a twenteen. And now it's time to decide whats next and I am not completely sure about it but something here tells me that everything will be fine.There are a lot of things that I have learnt here, I have learnt that people run by smart and not by bold and stupid.They all will count you as another sheep no matter how much love you pour onto them, it's never enough but in this world of harsh disaster there will be a few mysterious lovers who would stay by with a promise of forever love, I just don't know why. 
I would return with a lot of bags, most of them filled with birthday presents and souvenirs my friends bought me once. A few of them I will carry ahead with me to my next adventure. At the end, I must assure that I would never ever forget any of you and the adventures of our together.
Never say good bye, just ask when to meet again. :) 
We will meet again with smiles, leave again with tears because this is how it goes on.
