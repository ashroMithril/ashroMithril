Well, I thought of taking a better picture of this place but it seems that a few memories are better being blurred. <br>
I used to wait for my school bus here, the very first fantastic minutes of my morning, sometimes of misty winters, sometimes under the raining tree and mostly greeting the sun for being here again.<br>
A lot of future planning was done here, of the future after 20min with me in the classroom ans of the future after years whose destination was not yet decided but was dreamt of everyday,<br>
On my birthday, I dreamt of becoming a teacher, what else could be better than getting candies for free.<br>
On Independence day, with me standing in the red costume, I wanted to become a dancer, no restriction on music for life.<br>
They said the paper flowers I made were beautiful and anothwr dream of making an Art school with no H.W., no exams, where everyone could draw and make, turn their imaginations into reality.<br>
The craziest of all was to become the C.M (too much inspired by the movie 'Nayak') and fire the ones growing fat under the blood shed.<br>
And a lot more dreams still hang on this Y shaped tree on the right waiting for me to come with a basket and this turn each time reminds me of them.<br>
