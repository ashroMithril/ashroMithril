This love that you have given me ! <3 
<br>It's different then from what I had imagined, different from what I wondered it to be like. 
<br>I have this magic sprinkle over my head when you are around, there is something in that smile of yours, the way your eyes question, the way you want me to eat food, the way you walk with me holding hands, the way you come close and whisper a kiss. 
You are never afraid of teaching things, from eating habits to eating my own hands. You have become that second papa of mine, dadaji:D :P 
<br>There is so much to say that I could never finish and all this is going to be in my heart day by day increasing, and love you even more every single day. 
<br>You have actually changed the meaning of love for me, its not the seduction,  the urge, the obsession that two bodies have rather itâ€™s something so pure and creative that is difficult to put into words. 
It's actually about being happy in each others presence, sharing stories, poor jokes and enjoying each and every moment of your life with them. Knowing that there is someone to care for you, to love you, to accept you with all your imperfections and make you feel so special and let you know that you are deserving of all the love that he has given you and more that awaits. 
Thank you so much for all the love and care, I am blessed to have someone like you in my life ! <3 
I know I have said this infinite number of times but...
I LOVE YOU HITESH! <3 
I love you even more than yesterday and I will love you even more tomorrow! <3 
And I will love you for the rest of our lives! <3
