<br>I think of you all the time, 
<br>the time when I have some gain,
<br>the time when there is so much of pain,
<br>I think of you!
<br>Your smile is so magical,
<br>though it fills my eyes with tears. 
<br>but don't worry! there are no fears,
<br>these are just words and I am no Shakespeare,
<br>these are just vapours freshly condensed,
<br>of the memories that hit me when I am tensed.
<br>I miss you when I think of you!
<br>And not when I don't!
<br>So wake up and think- how many colors do I have,
<br>to write in exam tomorrow or else I am dead, 
<br>Stretching myself to give my notebook another try,
<br>reaching to the faith I failed long ago in the cry,
<br>I reach to my bottle, to just let me once again fly,
<br>Again I find it empty and completely dry.
<br>I think of you all the time, I just don't know why?
