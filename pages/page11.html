He caught my hand when the street was alarming and I had lost my way , and I just followed him in silence ..... observing ..... a thwart amongst so many noises.....
All big boxes with four wheels below , having a multiorganal specie sitting inside[who doesn't have any control over her/his own organs but] trying to control the four wheels ,because she thinks that she owns them and can control,why is that so that we can control the things we 'own'[don't we own our emotions as well] .These boxes are running in a hassle from one side of the road to the other with 'focused' lights but none of them actually know there destination.....
Someone holding another small box near his ear , promising his daughter that he would be on time for her performance , he knows he will not be there on time to cheer her while performing but still is trying to reach there to catch her after her performance , to hug her and say that she's the best dancer ever 

The otherone on a box with only 'two' wheels but having 'too' many dreams inside a very unreal place i.e. what they call...their HEART (^) . Desires kills and expectations are the culprit , And we work under these bombs which blasts us after every victory and defeat .When we win , the culprit actually gets an upgradation to kill us some more and when you lose , there is nothing much to say , but 'they' console ...
The luckiest one was the one with his beloved , holding his hands and changing the gears of life together .
There was another one without a box, walking orthogonally having some pieces of paper , I love a subject called 'MATH's , and my calculation told me he had the same pieces as I did . But we both were going to use it differently , he might buy sugar and tea for tomorrow after buying vegetables and I might spent them on a pizza with a tooty-frooty ice-cream . He must be wondering about his daughter's school fees , moving the three pieces clockwise that's how the clock moves but not his boss's ego... .
The best box , waiting for me on the otherside of the road had two nuts which screw me even on the phone :P , they were waiting for me since hrs , they had stars in their eyes [well actually it was the spark of getting their gifts asap] , There was another specie in that box , people call her 'Mother' , but she is more than that for me , I can look into her eyes , the deepest of them when she is elaborating on what happened this day and that day when I wasn't around .
He took me to the otherside of this world , and that world is mine forever .... he said
