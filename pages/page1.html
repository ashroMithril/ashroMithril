				<br>A part of me I was, a part of me I am <br> and a part of me I will be.
				<br>A whole but with lots of parts of myself, parts of thoughts, parts of 
				<br>memories, parts of trouble, parts of love, parts of
				<br>mistakes, parts of achievements, parts of him,
				<br>parts of her, parts of you and parts of me.
				<br>A part of me can agree to drama of your taste, 
				<br>a part of me will not as I eat from a different plate.
				<br>A part of me can forgive because humans are meant to make 
				<br>mistakes but a part of me will forget that you existed 
				<br>because apologies were way too late.
				<br>A part of me is shy as I take my own time, 
				<br>A part of me is high, cause I love to drink wine.
				<br>A part of me senses my eyes wathcing you all dance, 
				<br>Another part senses your eyes judging me at one glance.
				<br>A part of me can love, a part of me can hate,
				<br>Love the way you come close to me, hate the way
				<br>you say good bye!
				<br>A part of me is a poet, a part of me can't write,
				<br>A part of me dreams big, a part of me questions the same,
				<br>A part of me goes to class, a part of me stays back on the warm bed,
				<br>A part of me is home as well, a part of me with <br>the old friends,
				<br>A part of me running to the future, a part of me <br> fumbling back to the past,
				<br>A whole lot of me with lots of parts of myself.
				<br>I could be different if another part comes but all these <br>parts are in such a harmony, they never leave each other and <br>accepts new ones with all the heart.
				<br>But then again, only a part of me accepts it and a part of me <br>repels.
