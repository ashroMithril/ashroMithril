	<b style="font-size: 29px">A part of me I am.</b> <br>
<br>A part of me I was, a part of me I am and a part of me I will be.
<br>A whole but with lots of parts, parts of thoughts, parts of memories, parts of trouble, parts of love.
<br>A part of me can agree, a part of me will not,
<br>A part of me can forgive but the other can only forget,
<br>A part of me is shy, a part of me is high,
<br>A part of me senses my eyes, another senses their eyes,
<br>A part of me can love, a part of me can hate,
<br>A part of me is a poet, a part of me can't write,
<br>A part of me dreams big, a part of me questions,
<br>A part of me goes to class, a part of me stays back,
<br>A part of me is home as well, a part of me with the old friends,
<br>A part of me running to the future, a part of me fumbling back,
<br>A whole lot of me with lots of parts of myself.
<br>I could be different if another part comes but all these parts are in such a harmony, they never leave each other and accepts new ones with heart.
<br>But then again, only a part of me accepts and a part of me repels.
