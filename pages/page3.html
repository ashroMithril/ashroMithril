<br>Ambitions above the known,
<br>some got frozen under the zone,
<br>they stepped back counting to my faults,
<br>And I stepped on to my crown,
<br>wondering what if the sky was all mine,
<br>no wings but the strategy of the clouds,
<br>ohh me insane they change it every single time,
<br>leaving pieces of me all across the line,
<br>holding on to the ground,
<br>do you know what she had found,
<br>that mountains are the ones who live near the clouds,
<br>after this there were no more doubts,
<br>life is a big word, I had only moments,
<br>hop, laugh, and full your stomach in this park,
<br>and at the end, lights will lead you out of the dark,
<br>and remember dear, do not give up on what you desire,
<br>even if for it, you have to put yourself on fire !
<br><3
<br>Apoorva ! Apporva ! Appy ! App ! A :D
