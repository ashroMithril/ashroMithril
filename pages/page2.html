 <br>I write when I am in pain, people soak the outburst of my happiness very well but only lonely writing can soak my tears.
 <br> <br>If I ever made a promise, trust me I meant it!
 <br>I am not allowed to stay, but you will still see me standing there,
 <br>where we cherished the stars, where I felt alive for the first time,
 <br>you will see me hiding behind the door to peak a glance at your smile,
 <br>to see you riding into the sun, to see you crossing by me unknown,
 <br>To walk on the same streets as we once used to, trying to feel the warmth of your hands in mine,
 <br>To giggle on your PJs and then joining the echoes of silence again, just to be sane.

 <br>to think of you a thousand times, with tears rolling down,
 <br>a thunder to all the disaster.
 <br>Scared, shattered in my own belongings, I loved you but may be we were not supposed to be together,
 <br>You had no time and I had no patience.
 <br>We all have ambitions and it was malignant to trust but benign to dare,
 <br>And now, a part of me will always be with you and a part of you will always be with me.

 <br>For the one who I loved more than I loved myself.
