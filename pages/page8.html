<br>Remember the last time it was so tough,
<br>But you walked out happy and earned,
<br>Times keep oscillating like this,
<br>Don't put yourself on fire of disaster,
<br>calm down and let the rain drench you.
<br>It passed and this shall pass too!
<br>Try your best and never leave hope. 
<br>Its all meant for a reason, a good one I promise! to make your story exceptional.
