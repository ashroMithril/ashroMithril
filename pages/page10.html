She was trying to pull her little cycle out of the main gate, was going for a ride with her mom :D.
The little girl is young enough that the school must be a year ahead, and her cycle was triple of her own weight :P, but without caring about all that she was just pulling it hard to take the cycle stucked in the gate out. 
She was trying every angle by which she can make the cycle move, every possibility to pull it out, 
She kept trying but didn't called for help because may be she believed that she can do it on her own or may be she never knew that someone else can pull it out for her, because if she can't, no one else can and if anyone else can then why can't she!? 
Never thought of possible or impossible but kept trying and finally she did!
Kids are stubborn and they cry a lot and I hate that but, this spirit of her makes believe that she will be a strong and wise lady one day.
